CLI application using Python. Application for an imagined cafe to take orders from customers, add products to their menu or add couriers - as well as update/delete each of these. Data persisted to a database using Docker & SQL and allows for CRUD operations to be performed.

- possible improvements to be added:
- clean app_functions file & separate related functions to different files for readability
- error handling
- more tests
